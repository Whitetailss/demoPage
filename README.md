Welcome to my personal website!

Please open the index.html file to view my personal webpage. My ‘assets’  file contains three files including ‘images’, ‘css’ and ‘js’.

My webpage consists of different sections which are homepage, personal information, hobbies, portfolio of my creations and contact information. They are all accessible by the navigation bar sticking at the top. I used mainly light colours in the background to enhance attractiveness and user’s readability. Clicking the red-outlined mouse icon, user scrolls down to the following section. The four icons in ‘hobbies’, when hovered upon by the mouse, exhibit additional information including the hyperlinks directing to trailers and songs. In the portfolio session, the three dummies images will be replaced when my work is ready. At the bottom of my page lies my contact information.

I planned to create an animated background covering all space below my home-banner. However, due to the lack of time and my slight incompetence, its creation is postponed.
