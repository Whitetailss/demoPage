<h1> Hobbies </h1>

<h2> Piano </h2>

<p> Started playing at 8. Just like most kids, I <strong> don't practice </strong>. <em> Nope</em>, perhaps that why my scales always ended in single digits. Lets be honest, doing Czerny and Hanon, weeks after weeks, months after months and years after years, is a rather tedious job. Even though I knew of Chopin's existence, I didn't ask to play his pieces. This is dumb. <strong> VERY DUMB </strong>. </p>


<p> I found my passion to play the piano during my years studying in London. It's so difficult to find a free practice room in uni, especially when I'm not doing a music degree.


<p> From getting only single digits in scales in exams to playing it everyday now. It's quite a big difference. Playing the instrument is definitely a great way to get away from the breeze of life. </p>

<p> Still exploring through the massive library of good songs. <a href="https://youtu.be/c94nySKKoWE" title="Chopin Nocturne Op 48 No 1 in C minor"> This song </a> is one of my favourites. </p>

<h2> Tennis </h2>

<p> Federer is my favourite. </p>
